# Attention!!

##This project describes a device that connects to line voltage AC circuits and should only be attempted by those familiar and comfortable with working with electrical devices, especially the inner workings of electrical distribution panels.  Assistance by a qualified electrician is highly recommended.  Any attempt here to instruct the user in basic safety procedures should not be considered a substitute for experience and knowing what you are doing.  Please err on the side of caution and seek qualified assistance with all procedures relating to line voltage circuits.

Because the schematic is open and the software easily configured, different IoTaWatt devices can be built and work fine with the software.  What should be common is that the device should have a 5V USB power supply and support some number of input channels.  This tutorial will describe the version 2.2 IoTaWatt ADC shield implementation with AdaFruit feather ESP8266 and Adalogger boards.  It looks like this:

Connect a 9-12V AC reference voltage transformer to the 5mm power plug.

Insert a 16GB microSDHC card (preloaded with files from GitHub SDcard directory).

Connect to a 5V microUSB power supply.
