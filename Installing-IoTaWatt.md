The current revision of IotaWatt is tailored to working with a hardware offering developed in collaboration with [OpenEnergyMonitor](https://community.openenergymonitor.org/) (OEM).  The schematic for the latest version of the hardware is available on this GitHub site.  This tutorial illustrates the specific hardware implementation that will be offered through OEM, but should apply to any device built to the schematic and running the latest software release. The version 4 device looks like this:

The first step in installation is to connect it to power and an AC reference voltage.  Power is supplied by a 5vDC miniUSB power supply, and reference voltage is supplied through a 9-12VAC wall transformer using a 5.5mm connector. Go ahead and connect those and move on to the next step - [connecting to WiFi](https://github.com/boblemaire/IoTaWatt/wiki/Connecting-to-WiFi)
