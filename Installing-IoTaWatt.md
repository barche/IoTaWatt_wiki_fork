Because the schematic is open and the software easily configured, different IoTaWatt devices can be built and work fine with the software.  What should be common is that the device should have a 5V USB power supply and support some number of input channels.  This tutorial will describe the version 2.2 IoTaWatt ADC shield implementation with AdaFruit feather ESP8266 and Adalogger boards.  It looks like this:
