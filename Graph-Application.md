If you are uploading your data to Emoncms.org, there are a variety of ways to organize and view your voltage, power and energy use.  The server is fast and accessible from any place where there is internet connectivity.  But there are some circumstances under which you may want to access your data locally:

* You are not using Emoncms to save your data.
* You require finer resolution than is used in your Emoncms feeds.
* You have output channels defined on your IotaWatt that are not replicated on Emoncms.
* You want to post-process historic data using IotaWatt's output channel feature.

The local graphing feature is a fork of the Emoncms graphing application adapted to report the input and output channels of IotaWatt using the local LAN.  It is available on devices connected to the same WiFi network as the IotaWatt.
