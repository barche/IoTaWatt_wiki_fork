## Welcome to the IoTaWatt wiki!

Use the navigation links in the sidebar to find out more about IoTaWatt --->

The current revision of IotaWatt is tailored to working with a hardware offering developed in collaboration with [OpenEnergyMonitor](https://community.openenergymonitor.org/) (OEM).  The schematic for the latest version of the hardware (version 4) is available on this GitHub site.  This tutorial illustrates the specific hardware implementation that will be offered through OEM, but should apply to any device built to the schematic and running the latest software release (version 2).

## **Warning! Potentially Life Threatening Electrical Shock Hazard.**

**This project describes a device that uses sensors in proximity to line voltage AC circuits. Installation of sensors inside electrical distribution panels should only be done by a qualified electrician.  Others do so at their own risk. Any cautionary advice contained in this guide should not be considered a substitute for experience and training. Please error on the side of caution and seek qualified assistance with all procedures relating to line voltage circuits.**
