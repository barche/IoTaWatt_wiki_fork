The configuration app can provide a continuous updating display of the sample rates, running time, voltage, frequency, power and power-factor data that is being collected.  Simply click the **Input Channels Status** button.

# Samples per AC cycle

The recent average of the number of samples that the IoTaWatt collects each time it samples a channel. It will be around 500 if you are in a 60Hz country (As in North America), or 600 if you are in a 50Hz country (As in most of Europe).

### AC Cycles sampled per second

The recent average number of times the IoTaWatt sampled input channels. The maximum rate is 40 times per second at 60Hz, and 33 at 50Hz.  In practice, the average is less than the theoretical maximum because the device does other things in addition to sampling, but in general the rate should be 80%-95% of the maximum.
