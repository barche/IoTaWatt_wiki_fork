The IoTaWatt configuration app is a browser based HTML/Javascript application. There is a demo version installed at [iotawatt.com](http://iotawatt.com/) that can be used to follow along with much of the IoTaWatt configuration process described in the following sections.  If you don't have an actual IoTaWatt, you can get the look and feel of the device by playing with this app and following along in a different tab/window.

The Demo is limited in that it does not have an IoTaWatt to communicate with, but it can accurately simulate most of the configuration procedures described here.
